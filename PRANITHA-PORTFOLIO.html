    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Pranitha Thappatla. I am passionate about coding and technology. 
        I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology. 
        My hobbies are watching cricket, reading books, and listening to music. 
        My strengths include problem-solving skills and adaptability. 
        I can be shy at first, but I communicate well once I get comfortable. 
        My uniqueness is that I read books that improve my imagination and visualization skillsâ€”I can picture any scenario vividly.
